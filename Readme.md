An ActiveRecord-like [Neography](https://github.com/maxdemarzi/neography) wrapper.

The aim is to get as close as possible to the Active Record usage metods as possible. This gem relies on the Neo4j REST API. No JRuby! Yay!!

## Changelog

__v0.0.4__
> * Initial release (WIP)

## Installation
It's an early WIP. Install from here only at the moment.

## Configuration

Configure Neography separately [like here](https://github.com/maxdemarzi/neography/wiki/Configuration-and-initialization)

__OR__

just use the quick init method

```ruby
NeoActiveGraph.configure "http://user:pass@some-host.com:7474"
```

## Define Models

Define models for nodes and relationships.
Both types work almost alike, except that they inherit from different classes:

- __Nodes__ from `NeoActiveGraph::Node`

```ruby
class User < NeoActiveGraph::Node

  label "User"

  unique "USER_IDX", :name

  property :name, :type => String, :presence => true
  property :email, :type => String, :presence => true, :format => /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-.]+\.[a-z]+\z/i
  property :age, :type => Fixnum
end
```

- __Relationships__ from `NeoActiveGraph::Relationship`

```ruby
# TODO
```

## Usage

### Nodes

Creating and manipulating nodes...
