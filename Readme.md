# NeoActiveGraph
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pwaleczek/neo_active_graph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pwaleczek/neo_active_graph)
An ActiveRecord-like [Neography](https://github.com/maxdemarzi/neography) wrapper.

The aim is to get as close as possible to the Active Record usage metods as possible. This gem relies on the Neo4j REST API. No JRuby! Yay!!

## Installation
It's an early WIP. Install from here only at the moment.

## Configuration

Configure Neography separately [like here](https://github.com/maxdemarzi/neography/wiki/Configuration-and-initialization)

__OR__

just use the quick init method

```ruby
NeoActiveGraph.configure "http://user:pass@some-host.com:7474"
```
